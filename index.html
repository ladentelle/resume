						<em> 2008, 2010 & 2012 - HCCS Summer Enrichment</em> HCCS (Hunter College Campus Schools)
						Summer Enrichment Program is a program for gifted and talented children held
						at the campus of HCES  (Hunter College Elementary School) & HCHS (Hunter College
						High School) during the month of July. Students take  classes in several 
						subjects, taught by a combination of teachers from HCES and HS, as well as 
						unaffiliated teachers. The program is staffed by students from HCHS. I worked
						in several capacities, first as a student aide/counselor in 2008, a gym assistant 
						in 2010, and as an administrative assistant in 2012, where I played a vital role
						in the day-to-day running of the program, along with redesigning the program's logo. </li>

						<em> 2012-3 - James Gallery</em> The James gallery is an educational art space
						at CUNY's Graduate Center run by the Center for the Humanities. As an intern I 
						worked for class credit in school, as part of HCHS Scholars' program, which allows
						seniors to do an internship outside of school for a class credit. While working at
						the gallery, I worked in both the office and at events, doing duties such as documenting
						events via photograph, as well as office work and event set up. </li>

						<em> 2014 - Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society</em> The Center on Philanthropy
						and Civil Society, also at CUNY's Graduate Center, focuses on philanthropy and 
						non-profit organizations. My job involved a large amount of work with applications for
						the Center's Fellows Program, which brings individuals working in the non-profit
						sector to New York, where they meet professionals in the field and have opportunities to
						refine their skills. I also did graphic design work and started on the process of re-doing
						the center's website. </li>
